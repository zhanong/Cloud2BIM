# ===== INPUT/OUTPUT =====
e57_input: true # If true, convert E57 to XYZ; if false, use XYZ files directly
e57_files:

xyz_files: # Output path for converted XYZ or direct XYZ input files
  - output_xyz/454_Natoma_St.xyz
dilute: false # Reduce point density to speed up processing
dilution_factor: 10 # Keep every Nth point (higher = faster but less accurate)

# ===== POINT CLOUD PROCESSING =====
exterior_scan: false # True if scanned from outside; affects wall height calculation
pc_resolution: 0.02 # Point cloud resolution in meters (typical: 0.002-0.01)
grid_coefficient: 5 # Grid cell size = pc_resolution × grid_coefficient (affects wall detection granularity)
